# Zabbix monitoring of Bareos's backup jobs and its processes

This project is mainly composed by a bash script and a Zabbix template. The bash script reads values from Bareos Catalog and sends it to Zabbix Server. While the Zabbix template has items and other configurations that receive this values, start alerts and generate graphs and screens. This material was created using Bareos at 16.2.4 version and Zabbix at 3.2.4 version in a GNU/Linux CentOS 7 operational system.

### Abilities

- Customizable and easy to set up
- Separate monitoring for each backup job
- Different job levels have different severities
- Monitoring of Bareos Director, Storage and File processes
- Generates graphs to follow the data evolution
- Screens with graphs ready for display
- Works with MySQL and PostgreSQL used by Bareos Catalog

### Features

##### Data collected by script and sent to Zabbix

- Job exit status
- Number of bytes transferred by the job
- Number of files transferred by the job
- Time elapsed by the job
- Job transfer rate
- Job compression rate

##### Zabbix template configuration

Link this Zabbix template to each host that has a Bareos's backup job implemented. Each host configured in Zabbix with this template linked needs to have its name equals to the name configured in Bareos's Client resource. Otherwise the data collected by the bash script will not be received by Zabbix server.

- **Items**

  This Zabbix template has two types of items, the items to receive data of backup jobs, and the itens to receive data of Bareos's processes. The items that receive data of Bareos's processes are described below:

  - *Bareos Director is running*: Get the Bareos Director process status. The process name is defined by the variable {$BAREOS.DIR}, and has its default value as 'bareos-dir'. This item needs to be disabled in hosts that are Bareos's clients only.
  - *Bareos Storage is running*: Get the Bareos Storage process status. The process name is defined by the variable {$BAREOS.SD}, and has its default value as 'bareos-sd'. This item needs to be disabled in hosts that are Bareos's clients only.
  - *Bareos File is running*: Get the Bareos File process status. The process name is defined by the variable {$BAREOS.FD}, and has its default value as 'bareos-fd'.

  The items that receive data of backup jobs are divided into the three backup's levels: Full, Differential and Incremental. For each level there are six items as described below:

  - *Bytes*: Receives the value of bytes transferred by each backup job
  - *Compression*: Receives the value of compression rate of each backup job
  - *Files*: Receives the value of files transferred by each backup job
  - *OK*: Receives the value of exit status of each backup job
  - *Speed*: Receives the value of transfer rate of each backup job
  - *Time*: Receives the value of elapsed time of each backup job

- **Triggers**

  The triggers are configured to identify the host that started the trigger through the variable {HOST.NAME}. In the same way as the items, the triggers has two types too. The triggers that are related to Bareos's processes:

  - *Bareos Director is DOWN in {HOST.NAME}*: Starts a disaster severity alert when the Bareos Director process goes down
  - *Bareos Storage is DOWN in {HOST.NAME}*: Starts a disaster severity alert when the Bareos Storage process goes down
  - *Bareos File is DOWN in {HOST.NAME}*: Starts a high severity alert when the Bareos File process goes down

  And the triggers that are related to backup jobs:

  - *Backup Full FAIL in {HOST.NAME}*: Starts a high severity alert when a full backup job fails
  - *Backup Differential FAIL in {HOST.NAME}*: Starts a average severity alert when a differential backup job fails
  - *Backup Incremental FAIL in {HOST.NAME}*: Starts a warning severity alert when a incremental backup job fails

- **Graphs**

  Again, in the same way as the items related to backup jobs, the graphs are divided into the three backup's levels: Full, Differential and Incremental. For each level there are five graphs as described below:

  - *Bytes transferred*: Displays a graph with the variation of the bytes transferred by backup jobs, faced with the variation of the exit status of these jobs
  - *Compression rate*: Displays a graph with the variation of the compression rate by backup jobs, faced with the variation of the exit status of these jobs
  - *Elapsed time*: Displays a graph with the variation of the elapsed time by backup jobs, faced with the variation of the exit status of these jobs
  - *Files transferred*: Displays a graph with the variation of the files transferred by backup jobs, faced with the variation of the exit status of these jobs
  - *Transfer rate*: Displays a graph with the variation of the transfer rate by backup jobs, faced with the variation of the exit status of these jobs

- **Screens**

  There are three screens, one for each backup level, that displays the five graphs previously configured for that level.

### Requirements

- Bareos's implemented infrastructure and knowledge about it
- Zabbix's implemented infrastructure and knowledge about it
- Knowledge about MySQL or PostgreSQL databases
- Knowledge about GNU/Linux operational systems

### Installation

1. Create the configuration file `/etc/bareos/bareos-zabbix.conf` as the sample in this repository, customize it for your infrastructure environment, and set the permissions as below:
  ```
  chown root:bareos /etc/bareos/bareos-zabbix.conf
  chmod 640 /etc/bareos/bareos-zabbix.conf
  ```

2. Create the bash script file `/var/spool/bareos/bareos-zabbix.bash` by copying it from this repository and set the permissions as below:
  ```
  chown bareos:bareos /var/spool/bareos/bareos-zabbix.bash
  chmod 700 /var/spool/bareos/bareos-zabbix.bash
  ```

3. Edit the Bareos Director configuration file `/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf` (or the separate files in `/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/messages/Standart.conf`) to start the script at the finish of each job. To do this you need to change the lines described below in the Messages resource that is used by all the configured jobs:
  ```
  Messages {
    ...
    mailcommand = "/var/spool/bareos/bareos-zabbix.bash %i"
    mail = 127.0.0.1 = all, !skipped
    ...
  }
  ```

4. Now restart the Bareos Director service. In my case I used this command:
  ```
  systemctl restart bareos-dir
  ```

5. Make a copy of the Zabbix template from this repository and import it to your Zabbix server.

6. Edit your hosts that have configured backup jobs to use this template. Don't forget to edit the variables with the Bareos's processes names, and to disable in hosts that are only Bareos's clients the items that check the Bareos Director and Storage processes.
